# Facial Expression Detection

This project implements facial expression detection using a simple machine learning model. It processes images to detect facial expressions and classifies them into different emotion categories. The project avoids using OpenCV and relies on `PIL` (Pillow) for image processing and `scikit-learn` for machine learning.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You also need the following Python packages:

- `Pillow` for image processing
- `scikit-learn` for machine learning
- `numpy` for numerical operations

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install pillow scikit-learn numpy
