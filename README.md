# Facial-Emotion-Detection
This project implements facial expression detection using a simple machine learning model. It processes images to detect facial expressions and classifies them into different emotion categories. The project avoids using OpenCV and relies on PIL (Pillow) for image processing and scikit-learn for machine learning.
